# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
In todayâ€™s world, most of the people who suffer from problems related to speech communicate with others using their hand gestures. Although most of these gestures are quite common, most of the commoners are unable to understand these gestures. This sometimes creates an unwanted communication barrier between two people. We need a communication medium that can help us to bridge this gap and make the hand gesture a universal medium of communication. We propose a model-based upon Machine Learning and Image Processing that can work with Gesture recognition. This model is capable of taking a live input from a camera and processing it in realtime.
